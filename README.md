## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
This project is an instagram page for codespace pets. It is a simplified version of the original page which includes the profile picture, settings and edit buttons and the typical instagram picture layout. 

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: When it comes to using flexbox and grid, I am able to understand the concepts at a base level. I understand enough to use them while refering to notes but otherwise I am still very confused as to how the container functions.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is currently responsive at the top (profile picture and content) and unresponsive when the pictures come into play. 
- **Styling Elements**: This is the concept that I am most confident in since we have grappled with it the longest. Adding colors, borders and fonts was the highlight of the project for me.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: The media queries, I found most challenging. I attempted to use them in this code but eneded up erasing them due to them changing nothing when previewing, this pointed out that I was using them incorrectly.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Hover and focus effects were fairly easy for me to master as they were also utilised during the intro into CSS.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: Unfortunately, I was unable to fully understand the code that I made. The way in which containers are used and the overall layout concept, I still need to dive deeper and do more practice.
- **Code Optimization**: The code could be better interms of functionality and design. It does fairly resemble the original Instagram page but is still not fully responsive.
- **Creative Design Choices**: The page looks exactly like the instagram page, with no personal styling. I changed the focus feature to a different color and that is the only changed feature.

#### Overall Learning Experience
This project was by far the most challenging because of the lengthy code and intoduction to layouts. It was also the most interesting to see such a popular page come to life with my own code. I look forward to practicing more to build enough undestanding for better future codes.
